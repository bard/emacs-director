# Director: Simulate Emacs user sessions

Director drives an Emacs session from the point of view of the user. It can be
used for end-to-end testing, hands-free screencast recording, probably more.

Director is similar in spirit to web tools such as Selenium Webdriver. It is
_not_ a general purpose solution for Emacs automation; use Lisp for that.

## Status

Developer preview, low-level API only. Currently used in
[run-command](https://github.com/bard/emacs-run-command).
